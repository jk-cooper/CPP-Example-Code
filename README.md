# CPP-Example-Code

This was a final project for my data structures course.  Our assignment was to showcase as much of the course material we learned as possible.  In doing so, I created a graph using pre-existing classes such as a linked list that was a previous assignment in the course.  The method used to create the graph was to create a linked list of linked lists that would store the graph's vertices and edges.  This project is not complete as there is not a depth first search nor a breadth first search.  There is also some code that can polished.  I intend to work further on this code for personal development.
